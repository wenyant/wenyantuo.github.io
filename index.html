            <p><strong>Title:</strong> Platform Brands Rising: The Competitive and Perceptual Consequences of Amazon Brands Entry <br>
            <strong>Abstract:</strong> This study examines the impact of platform brand entry on competing products sold on the platform. In the context of Amazon.com, we identify 66 markets where Amazon introduced its Amazon brands and use a staggered Synthetic Difference-in-Differences (SynthDID) model to estimate the effects on market price, engagement, and consumer perception. We find that entry of Amazon brands significantly reduces market price and price dispersion. For the competing products, the Amazon brand entry increases consumer engagement, measured by the number of product reviews, and improves product ratings.  Yet, these competitive gains come at a perception cost: both perceived value and quality decline after the entry of Amazon brands. This suggests that while platform brands stimulate efficiency, they may simultaneously raise consumer expectations and undermine perceived product differentiation.  To understand which products are most exposed to this shifting pressure, we implement a panel-adapted Double Machine Learning (DML) framework with a multi-modal product embedding to measure product similarity as a key moderator. We find that the third-party sellers, who offer moderately similar products to the Amazon brand, face the most pronounced negative effects. Our findings generate valuable managerial and policy insights regarding digital platforms and third-party sellers on these platforms.<br>
